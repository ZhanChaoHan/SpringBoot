== Spring Data JDBC mybatis

`MyBatisTests` demonstrates how some queries executed by Spring Data JDBC can be replaced with MyBatis mappings.
The domain model is based on the basic JDBC example for comparison.

The map of models is maintained by two statements configured in MyBatis mappings.

`example.springdata.jdbc.mybatis.LegoSetMapper.findAllByProperty-models` showcases how a map can be loaded by configuring the select to return instances of `Map.Entry`

`example.springdata.jdbc.mybatis.Model.insert` showcases how one can access the `MyBatixContext` and thereby the instance to save and the key of the parent entity.
