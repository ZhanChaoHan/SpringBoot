== Spring Data JDBC with jOOQ

The `JooqMethods` class demonstrates how to access a database with jOOQ in combination with Spring Data JDBC.
The domain model is based on the basic JDBC example for comparison.
Another interesting aspect of this code could be the jOOQ configuration in the `pom.xml` file.

To execute the tests, execute:
[indent=0]
----
	$ mvn test
----

The code generator is automatically run when executing the tests.
If you want to rerun the code generator manually, just execute the following command:
[indent=0]
----
	$ mvn clean generate-sources
----
