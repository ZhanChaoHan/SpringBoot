# Spring Data Couchbase - Examples

This project contains samples of data access features with Spring Data (Couchbase).

## Prerequisites

The examples require a running [Couchbase Server](https://www.couchbase.com/downloads) server with the travel sample bucket imported. We assume you're running Couchbase 6.5 and we have updated the `application.properties` class accordingly to adapt RBAC authentication.

For more information, see the [official documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/couchbase/docs/current/reference/html/#reference).
